# GitHub to JIRA import tool

## Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/rmetzger/github2jira.git
cd github2jira
cp config.properties.default config.properties
mvn clean package
```

The tool is using the following libraries:
- "jira-client": https://github.com/rcarz/jira-client (LGPL)
- "GitHub Java API (org.eclipse.egit.github.core)": https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github/tree/master/org.eclipse.egit.github.core (EPL - http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)

This work is private and has nothing to do with the Apache Software foundation.


Limitations:
- No conversion of Markdown into JIRA syntax (except for links)
- The code assumes that the GitHub issue ID = JIRA issue id (so you basically have to do the import against an empty JIRA project)
- maybe more ;)

Use the "Issues" here to send me feedback or questions.
